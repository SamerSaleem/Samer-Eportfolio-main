                        <br>

						<p>Business Continuity (BC) and Disaster Recovery (DR) are essential components of an organization’s risk management strategy. BC refers to the processes and procedures that ensure critical business functions continue during and after a disruptive event, such as a natural disaster or cyber attack. DR, on the other hand, focuses specifically on restoring IT systems and data after a disruption, ensuring that the organization can resume normal operations in a timely manner.</p>

						<p>Two critical metrics in BC and DR planning are Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO). RTO is the maximum acceptable length of time that a system can be down after a disaster occurs before causing significant harm to the organization. For example, if an organization has an RTO of four hours, it must restore services within that timeframe to minimize operational impact. RPO, on the other hand, defines the maximum acceptable amount of data loss measured in time. An RPO of one hour means that in the event of a disruption, the organization can afford to lose only one hour's worth of data.</p>
						
						<p>To meet specific recovery objectives, organizations should implement suitable solutions that align with their RTO and RPO requirements. For organizations with stringent RTO and RPO needs, traditional on-premise backup solutions may not suffice. Instead, organizations can consider adopting a <strong>Disaster Recovery as a Service (DRaaS)</strong> model, which leverages cloud technology for data replication and recovery. This approach not only enhances the speed of recovery but also minimizes the physical infrastructure required for DR. Moreover, cloud DRaaS providers often offer automated failover and failback processes, reducing manual intervention and further decreasing recovery times.</p>
						
						<p>The future of the Information Risk Management field is being driven by several factors, particularly as organizations increasingly adopt cloud solutions. One significant trend is the shift toward <strong>cloud-native applications</strong>, which are designed specifically to run in cloud environments. These applications often utilize microservices architecture, making them inherently more resilient and scalable. This adaptability allows organizations to recover more swiftly from disruptions while also optimizing resources.</p>
						
						<p>Furthermore, the concept of <strong>shared responsibility</strong> is vital in cloud environments. In a shared responsibility model, cloud providers are responsible for the security of the cloud infrastructure, while organizations are responsible for securing their applications and data within that cloud. This distinction emphasizes the need for organizations to understand their role in risk management and to implement robust security measures in conjunction with their cloud provider's offerings.</p>
						
						<p>Another factor influencing the future of Information Risk Management is the increasing reliance on various types of cloud deployments, including public, private, and hybrid clouds. Each of these models has its own advantages and challenges, and organizations must carefully evaluate their specific needs and regulatory requirements when determining which model to adopt. For instance, while public clouds offer scalability and cost-effectiveness, private clouds provide enhanced security and control, making them suitable for sensitive data.</p>
						
						<p>In conclusion, as organizations navigate the complexities of Information Risk Management, understanding BC, DR, RTO, and RPO is crucial for developing effective recovery strategies. By leveraging cloud technologies, organizations can enhance their resilience against disruptions while adapting to the evolving landscape of information security and risk management.</p>

<p><strong>Summary Post:</strong> </p>

<p>While authors focused on the limitations of the CVSS, there are alternative solutions to overcome these limitations, such as using other tools to fill the gaps that CVSS leaves.</p>

<p>Example of such tools:</p>

<h4>FAIR (Factor Analysis Information Risk):</h4>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> FAIR is a risk analysis framework that provides a quantitative approach to understanding and measuring information security and operational risks. It allows for a more nuanced view of risk by considering the likelihood of loss events and the magnitude of potential impacts.</p>
<p><strong>Advantages:</strong> Unlike CVSS, FAIR integrates financial impact and contextual factors into risk analysis, making it more suitable for decision-making in business contexts. (The Open Group, 2018)</p>

<h4>Bayesian Networks:</h4>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> Bayesian networks model the probabilistic relationships between variables, allowing for dynamic updates as new information becomes available.</p>
<p><strong>Advantages:</strong> These networks can incorporate uncertainty and context, making them more flexible and accurate than CVSS in certain situations. (Wang, J., et al. 2020)</p>

<h4>Practical Implementation:</h4>
<p><strong>Combining Tools:</strong> Organisations often use CVSS in conjunction with other tools. For instance, CVSS can serve as an initial vulnerability assessment, while tools like FAIR or Bayesian networks can be used for deeper risk analysis.</p>
<p><strong>Customisation:</strong> Tailoring these tools to the organisation's specific context and integrating them with business objectives can enhance their effectiveness.</p>

<p>On the other hand, CVSS has evolved through multiple versions, aiming to address known limitations and adapting to changes in the cybersecurity landscape. However, while these improvements are significant, they may not fully resolve all the criticisms or meet the diverse needs of all users.</p>

<h4>Key Improvements in Newer CVSS Versions:</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Contextual Scoring:</strong> CVSSv3.x introduced environmental and temporal metrics to better account for the context in which a vulnerability exists. This allows for a more refined assessment based on specific circumstances rather than a one-size-fits-all score.</li>
    <li><strong>Complexity and Impact Consideration:</strong> Newer versions also offer more granular metrics for assessing the impact of a vulnerability, including considerations for attack complexity and the potential impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability.</li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, to address the potential for misuse or misinterpretation, ongoing efforts are needed to improve user guidance and education, ensuring that organizations can effectively use CVSS in conjunction with other tools. (MITRE, 2021)</p>
