										<h2>Module1-Launching into cyber security</h2>

									<p><strong>Unit 3 - Summary</strong>><br>
										In summary, cyber security is becoming a persistent need in every aspect of life. <br>
										economic activities and national security depend on stability, safety, 
										and resilient cyberspace. A network brings communications and transport, 
										power to homes, runs the economy, and provides governments with various services. 
										However, the same cyber networks intrude and attack our privacy, economy, 
										and social life in a harmful way. Madhu T., 2017).

                                        Agreeing with Ilyas Demirtas how important to have security considered at the early stages of design, 
										for security to be robust at any organization, be it a network, software, mobile application, 
										or an IoT device or operating system. 
										A suitable design model should be used to implement an efficient product with the initial essential security functions. 
										for software, security should be part of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) allowing the detection of defects 
										and lowering the cost of fixing errors before the release (James R. 2021).
                                        <br>
                                        After product release, a plan to improve the security posture should be put as part of the security audit and assessment process (Kris H. 2023).
                                        Furthermore, a key element in security is following a framework to reduce security risk, the organization’s requirements are essential in selecting the suitable framework, HIPAA for health sectors in the US or the Data Protection Act 2018 for the UK. Setting policies and rules and following GDPR is as can be described as “road to compliance” (Kris H., 2023).
                                        <br>Plethora of examples of how data breaches can be devastating to society, like the Shell Group data breach, the impact on user information being leaked is a failure in protecting the triad of data CIA, which is an important concept in the information security industry and is used in ISO 27001, a global standard for managing information security.
                                        The GDPR also mentioned in Article 32, that it requires organizations to use appropriate measures to protect the confidentiality, integrity, availability, and resilience of their information processing systems and services(Luke I., 2023).

									--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
									<strong>Learning Outcome:</strong><br>
									Attending seminars for unit1,2,3 and preparing for the discussions and going through the reading lists has brought my attention<br>
									to the following points:<br>
									1.Cyber Security design should be involved from early stages of a project.<br>
									2.Security breach impac/damage on organization supasses financial damage to other aspects like reputational, physical and intellectual damage<br>
									3.the importance of GDPR and similar frameworks and regulation in data protection and privacy of individuals and groups.<br>
									4.Ross Anderson lectures on Security Engineering proves security is important side that need continous development <br>
									5.Ross Anderson shows that governments can use ignore or bend the laws and policies to their benefits.<br>
									
									--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
									Reading list of Unit 3 - Writing Secure Code <br>
									Reasons people overlook security?<br>
									1. boring <br>
									2. considered as blocker <br>
									3. difficult <br>
									4. not a primary skills like coding <br>
									5. not exciting and old <br>
									
									How to improve process of security? <br>
									Insert security in software/product development <br>
									Design >>> Development >>> Test >>> shipping/maintenance <br>
									Remembering that having security features != secure features<br>

									How important for code writer to know what is Buffer overun problem in a code? <br>
									Notes: Security at design phase means less cost than security after product release. and easier to fix as well.<br>
									you should know by now that security is considered a feature as well.<br>

									Threat Modeling?<br>
									it is a way to list your threats by defining your assets and what you think need to be protected and why it can be attacked<br>

									Building End of Life plans<br>
									software do not die, they just become insecure.<br>
									when fixing bugs, think about fixing the bugs that matter, reduce the attack surface and this should lower the bugs as well.<br>

									Development phase:<br>
									1. revoke the coders ability to write/update codes until they finish security bootcamp.<br>
									2. security peer review for codes pushed and use mechanisims to show file diffs between before/after code push to be viewed by peers before approving them.<br>
									3. define secure code guidelines on how codes should be pushed.<br>
									4. review old defects and learn from mistakes.<br>
									5. use external security review (auditing).<br>
									6. track your bug metrics.<br>
									7. use programs like bug bountry internally to motivate bug discovery<br>

									Test phase:<br>
									how you know you are done with your security practice of the product?<br>
									basically if you acheived your goals from the defined list in design phase.<br>
									add a readme file to address the known issues.<br>

												Software Design (OOP, OOA, OOD , UML) programming, analysis, Design <br>

												Design is part of software development process, where design is the process <br>
												of taking requirements and what need to be done and how, this means moving the software<br>
												building process from from design(analysis) to implementation stage.<br>
												This can be done by using UML (Unified Modeling Language) to create diagrams<br>
												* class diagrams
												for example: if we have objects like oranges and apples which should go into objects like baskets and barrels<br>
												these are 4 objects, but if we have two oranges and bascket this means we have two objects that will go into same basket<br>
												here basket is a class while the oranges are object and same for the apples.<br>

												Reference:<br>
												Phillips, D. (2018) Python 3 object-oriented programming: Build robust and maintainable software with object-oriented design patterns in Python 3.8. Packt Publishing Ltd.<br>

												Learning outcome:<br>
												Reproduce the Abuse case diagrams, <br>
												sequence diagrams and class diagrams provided in the lecturecast.<br>
												Export diagrams to a Word document.<br>
												
												Collaborative Discussion task Unit 6 week1:<br>
												There are many corners to cover in building secure business networks. Two of the most important layers to discuss are protecting 
												the network border security by implementing next-generation firewalls which have the ability of IPS/IDS 
												to detect and protect against threats A next-generation firewall (NGFW) is a network security device that 
												provides capabilities beyond a traditional, stateful firewall. 
												While a traditional firewall typically provides stateful inspection of incoming and outgoing network traffic, 
												a next-generation firewall includes additional features like 
												application awareness and control, integrated intrusion prevention,
												 and cloud-delivered threat intelligence. (Santos Omar, 2014)
												Providing features including packet filtering, URL blocking, VPN and other features not found in traditional firewalls. These include 
												intrusion prevention, SSL and SSH inspection, deep-packet inspection, and reputation-based malware detection, 
												as well as application awareness. (Clark, 2021)
												On the other hand, endpoint security is a crucial line of defense against security threats inside the network. 
												to safeguard the network from internal and external actors, diversifying security solutions is the best approach 
												to protect the business network. Protecting devices like workstations, servers, and other devices (that can accept a security client) from malicious threats and cyberattacks. 
												Endpoint security software enables businesses to protect devices that employees use for work purposes or servers that are either on a network or in the cloud from cyber threats. (Buckbee, 2023)<br>
