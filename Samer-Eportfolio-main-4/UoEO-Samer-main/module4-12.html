		<h1><strong>Risk Management Module Reflection</strong><br></h1>
		By: Samer Saleem<br>
		E-Portfolio Link: <a href="https://github.com/SamerSaleem/Samer-Eportfolio-main">https://github.com/SamerSaleem/Samer-Eportfolio-main</a><br>
	
	</p>
	
	<p>
		<h2><strong>Risk Management Module: In the Beginning!</strong></h2>
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Embarking on the risk management module at the University of Essex marked a significant turning point in my academic journey. Prior to this course, my understanding of risk management was superficial, grounded primarily in a few YouTube videos and the CISSP training programme I had undertaken. Despite my efforts, I found that these resources did not provide the depth or breadth of knowledge necessary to fully grasp the complexities of the subject. The absence of practical experience left me with only a vague idea of risk management concepts, making it challenging to engage meaningfully with the topic.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		The risk management module has greatly benefited from the supportive environment fostered by our tutors, who facilitated engaging discussions and collaborative document sharing after seminars. These interactions have introduced me to various methodologies and frameworks essential for effective risk assessment and mitigation, challenging my initial perceptions and enhancing my critical thinking about the relationship between risk and organisational performance. While I've gained valuable insights, I recognize that I’ve only scratched the surface of this vast field. The extensive reading list provided further underscores the depth of knowledge available, prompting me to revisit these resources for deeper understanding. This reflection will discuss my journey through the module, focusing on two key events that have significantly shaped my learning experience.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Assessments and Challenges: Major Events during the Module</strong>
	</p>
	
	<p>
		<strong>A. Team versus Individual Work for Assessments in Unit 6</strong><br>
		In Unit 6, our group project for the risk assessment of Pampered Pets highlighted the dynamics of teamwork in risk management. Collaborating with my peers—Gesine, Mauricio, Farhad, and Tobias—was a valuable experience that showcased the benefits of diverse perspectives and shared responsibilities. However, balancing individual accountability with group contributions also presented challenges. I learned the importance of compromise, communication, and collective decision-making in achieving a cohesive outcome.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		<strong>Challenge working with the team:</strong><br>
		• 	Team did not focus on aligning the risk assessment report to current Cyber Security which was related to network shared wireless and use of outdated computer/software in Pampered Pets which embeds network security threats before the digital transformation of Pampered Pets, and human factor and financial risk must be considered in risk assessment.
In future if I worked with other team assigned projects to strongly stand behind my ideas in the same way I do at work and this confidence should come from technical experience in the network security field.
.<br>
		• The team created a complicated plan with numerous tasks tracked in different files (OneNote, Word documents, Excel Sheets), making it confusing to monitor changes and progress towards the final report. I would prefer a simpler plan to break down the original tasks and be more technical and critical in associating tasks with Cyber Security rather than providing a generic report.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		<strong>What Was the Learned Lesson on a Personal Level?</strong><br>
		• I learned not to give credit for peer efforts blindly and to be critical, as this impacted my score in the peer evaluation.<br>
		• Working with new teams can be challenging due to differing backgrounds and expertise. It's crucial to provide logical reasoning with opinions to enhance peer understanding and cooperation.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>B. Team versus Individual Work for Assessments in Unit 11</strong><br>
		In contrast, Unit 11’s assessment emphasized individual contributions, pushing me to apply the concepts learned throughout the course to a more personal context. While working independently allowed for greater flexibility in expressing my understanding of risk management, it also required me to draw heavily on the knowledge gained from previous units. The transition from collaborative work to individual assessments underscored the need for self-discipline and personal accountability in risk management practices. This shift allowed me to reflect on my learning journey, reinforcing the significance of individual initiative in identifying and addressing risks. I recognized the necessity of synthesizing information and applying it to real-world scenarios. Moreover, working on this assessment gave me more freedom to include technical content like the multi-cloud designs, which are being introduced as a solution to many low-latency service businesses.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		<strong>Last Seminar Reflection (The Great Debate: What will be the most influential trend in SRM in the next 5 years?)</strong><br>
		Reflecting on the last seminar and the debate during the session, I agree with the presentation by Gesine. I believe that AI/ML is the most significant trend in the next five years due to the following: AI is undoubtedly one of the most trending technologies today, with far-reaching implications across multiple sectors. Recent reports demonstrate that AI has grown exponentially due to advancements in machine learning, neural networks, and data analytics, playing a transformative role in industries such as healthcare, finance, and automation. According to the AI Index Report 2024, the private sector is leading AI's development, producing 51 key machine learning models compared to academia, indicating the growing reliance on AI for practical and commercial applications (Zhang et al., 2024).<br>
		One major trend is the rise of generative AI, which has attracted significant investment. In 2023 alone, generative AI startups received $25.2 billion in funding—nine times more than the previous year, highlighting how crucial this technology has become for innovations like automated content creation, image generation, and customer service bots (Saxena et al., 2024). Moreover, AI's ability to automate processes has demonstrated notable productivity enhancements in various fields. From streamlining manufacturing processes to improving data-driven decision-making in organizations, AI has proven itself as a critical tool for operational efficiency (Miller, 2023). AI’s influence is not limited to productivity; it has also reshaped scientific research, accelerating the discovery process through AI-driven models that predict outcomes and generate new datasets for innovation (Sharma & Patel, 2023).
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Why would AI become the most trending in SRM?</strong><br>
		This is due to the following factors:<br>
		1. <strong>Adversarial Attacks:</strong> AI models can be manipulated by adversarial attacks, where malicious actors input slightly altered data that can lead to incorrect outputs. These attacks undermine the reliability of AI systems, especially in critical applications like autonomous driving and facial recognition. Research indicates that even minor modifications to input can drastically change the model's predictions (Yuan et al., 2019).<br>
		2. <strong>Data Poisoning:</strong> This risk involves corrupting the training data that AI systems rely on, leading to skewed results and compromised decision-making. Attackers can insert false data into the training dataset, making the AI model less effective or biased. This poses significant risks for machine learning models, especially in sectors like finance and healthcare (Biggio & Roli, 2018).<br>
		3. <strong>Model Theft:</strong> Cybercriminals can steal AI models to replicate their functionality without authorization. This not only leads to intellectual property theft but also raises concerns over how the stolen models may be misused. Techniques for stealing models include query attacks, where an attacker can interact with the model to learn its structure and parameters (Raji & Buolamwini, 2019).<br>
		4. <strong>Lack of Robustness:</strong> Many AI systems lack the robustness needed to perform well under different conditions or in the presence of noise. This can lead to failures in critical systems where reliability is essential, such as healthcare diagnostics and autonomous systems (Huang et al., 2021).<br>
		5. <strong>Privacy Violations:</strong> AI systems often require large datasets that may contain sensitive personal information. The potential for misuse of this data or unintended exposure poses significant privacy risks. Techniques like data anonymization can help, but they are not foolproof, and breaches can lead to severe consequences (Kizilcec, 2016).<br>
	</p>
	
	<p>
		As opposed to what Toby mentioned about “Risk Management Maturity,” which I think is an issue that AI itself can help in fixing, the human factor in decision-making poses significant risks, particularly in high-stakes environments. Cognitive biases, such as confirmation bias and anchoring, can distort judgment and lead to suboptimal choices (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974). Additionally, emotional influences and stress can impair decision quality, resulting in errors that can have serious consequences (Schwartz et al., 2002).
	</p>
	
	<p>
		<strong>How Can AI solve Security Risk Management issues?</strong><br>
		AI can significantly enhance security risk management (SRM) by providing advanced analytical capabilities, automating threat detection, and improving incident response times. Here are several key ways AI contributes to addressing SRM issues:<br>
		1. <strong>Predictive Analytics:</strong> AI algorithms can analyze historical data to identify patterns and trends, allowing organizations to predict potential security threats before they materialize. This proactive approach can help in mitigating risks effectively (Sharma & Patel, 2023).<br>
		2. <strong>Automated Threat Detection:</strong> Machine learning models can continuously monitor networks and systems for unusual activity, flagging potential security incidents in real time. This capability reduces the time it takes to identify threats, enabling quicker responses (Kumar et al., 2022).<br>
		3. <strong>Enhanced Incident Response:</strong> AI-powered systems can streamline incident response processes by providing actionable insights and recommendations based on data analysis. This can improve decision-making during security incidents, leading to more effective resolutions (Nair et al., 2021).<br>
		4. <strong>Vulnerability Management:</strong> AI tools can prioritize vulnerabilities based on contextual factors, such as the organization's specific environment and threat landscape. This prioritization helps security teams focus on the most critical vulnerabilities, thereby optimizing resource allocation (Thakur et al., 2023).<br>
		5. <strong>Fraud Detection:</strong> In sectors like finance, AI can analyze transaction patterns to identify potentially fraudulent activities, enhancing overall security and reducing financial losses (Ali et al., 2023).
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Conclusion:</strong> In conclusion, AI serves as a transformative tool in security risk management by leveraging data analytics to predict, detect, and respond to threats more effectively than traditional methods.
