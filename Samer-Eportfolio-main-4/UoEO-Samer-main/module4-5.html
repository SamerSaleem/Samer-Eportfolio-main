					<h3>Crypto Ransomware Attack on a Primary School</h3>
					<p><strong>Formative Activity</strong></p>

					<p>In October 2016, a primary school reported a breach resulting from a “Crypto Ransomware” attack. Parts of the school’s information systems were encrypted by a third party, making the school's files inaccessible. These files contained personal details, including names, dates of birth, and Personal Public Service Numbers (PPSNs). A ransom was demanded from the school to release the encrypted files.</p>
					
					<p>Our assessment of the attack identified several deficiencies in the school’s measures to secure pupils’ personal data, including:</p>
					<ul>
					   <li>No policies or procedures in place to maintain adequate backups.</li>
					   <li>No procedures or policy documents focusing on system attacks such as ransomware or viruses.</li>
					   <li>No contracts with data processors (the ICT services providers), as required under Section 2C(3) of the Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003, leading to inadequate actions by the ICT suppliers in response to the attack.</li>
					   <li>A lack of staff training and awareness of the risks associated with opening unknown email attachments or files.</li>
					</ul>
					
					<p>We concluded that the school had contravened the provisions of Section 2 (1) (d) of the Acts by failing to ensure adequate security measures were in place to protect against unauthorized processing and disclosure of personal data.</p>
					
					<p>Recommendations were issued to the school to mitigate the risks identified. The school subsequently informed us that it had taken the following steps based on the recommendations:</p>
					<ul>
					   <li>Implemented a staff training and awareness program on the risks associated with email and the use of personal USB keys.</li>
					   <li>Started a contract review process to ensure appropriate contracts were in place with its ICT suppliers.</li>
					   <li>Ensured that any ICT support the school engages, either locally or as recommended by the Board, is performed by competent data processors.</li>
					</ul>
					
					<p>This case demonstrates that schools, like any other organization — commercial, public sector, or private — operating electronic data storage systems and interacting online must ensure that they have appropriate technical security and organizational measures in place to prevent the loss of personal data and to ensure they can restore data in the event of Crypto Ransomware attacks.</p>
					
					<h4>Specific Aspect of GDPR Addressed</h4>
					<p><strong>Integrity and Confidentiality:</strong> The personal data compromised by a third party was modified and became inaccessible, addressing key principles of GDPR related to data integrity and security.</p>
					
					<h4>How Was It Resolved?</h4>
					<p>The school followed recommendations to mitigate the issue, which included:</p>
					<ul>
					   <li>Implementing staff training and awareness programs on email risks and the use of personal USB devices.</li>
					   <li>Reviewing and updating contracts with ICT suppliers to ensure compliance.</li>
					   <li>Engaging competent data processors for ICT support.</li>
					</ul>
					
					<h4>Steps to Take as an Information Security Manager</h4>
					<p>If this were my organization, I would take the following steps to mitigate the issue:</p>
					<ol>
					   <li>Train staff and continuously reinforce cyber awareness.</li>
					   <li>Limit USB access to mitigate data exposure risks.</li>
					   <li>Establish service contracts with ICT providers to ensure appropriate attention to school requirements.</li>
					   <li>Create a policy that includes a disaster recovery and backup plan along with endpoint security measures.</li>
					   <li>Adhere to GDPR principles:</li>
					   <ul>
						  <li><strong>Lawfulness, Fairness, and Transparency:</strong> Ensure that processing is lawful, fair, and transparent to data subjects.</li>
						  <li><strong>Purpose Limitation:</strong> Process data only for legitimate purposes specified to the data subject at collection.</li>
						  <li><strong>Data Minimization:</strong> Collect and process only the necessary amount of data for the specified purposes.</li>
						  <li><strong>Accuracy:</strong> Keep personal data accurate and up to date.</li>
						  <li><strong>Storage Limitation:</strong> Retain personally identifiable data only as long as necessary for the specified purpose.</li>
						  <li><strong>Integrity and Confidentiality:</strong> Ensure appropriate security, integrity, and confidentiality through measures such as encryption.</li>
						  <li><strong>Accountability:</strong> Be able to demonstrate GDPR compliance with all of these principles.</li>
					   </ul>
					</ol>

<h2>Wiki Article: Frameworks and Recommendations for Different Organizations</h2>

<p>In this article, we will discuss the appropriate cybersecurity and management frameworks for three distinct types of organizations: an international bank, a large hospital, and a large food manufacturing factory. Each of these organizations has unique security needs, and applying the right framework is crucial for mitigating risks, complying with industry standards, and protecting sensitive data. Additionally, we will summarize the key tests and recommendations for each organization to help ensure effective implementation of these frameworks.</p>
